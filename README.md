This is a toy project to learn a little bit about the [GMail SDK](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides)
The MAIN class is basically a clone of the GMailQuickstart sample

I email myself links (usually from hacker news) with the intent to read the details of the articles later. 
I set up a filter that automatically tags these sorts of messages with the label `dev_link`. 
Unfortunately I rarely get back to them
I thought I'd use this API to find out how far behind I Am (Maybe I didn't actually want to know)
